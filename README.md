# Sales-Analysis-Using-MySQL
This project analyzes the sales data from a retail store chain. Using MySQL queries, we explore key sales trends, department performances, the impact of various features (holidays, markdowns, economic conditions, etc.), and other business-critical factors. The dataset consists of sales, store, and features tables.
